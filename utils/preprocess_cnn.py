    # In this code snippet, we define two functions:  preprocess_image  and  preprocess_dataset . The  preprocess_image  function loads an image, resizes it to the target size (224Ã—224 pixels), and normalizes the pixel values to the range [0, 1]. The  preprocess_dataset  function processes all images in a dataset folder by calling the  preprocess_image  function on each image. 
    # We then use these functions to preprocess the images in the  real  and  fake  folders and save the processed images in the  real_processed  and  fake_processed  folders, respectively. 
    # Now that we have preprocessed the images, we can proceed to the next step: loading the preprocessed images and their corresponding labels. 
    # Step 2: Load Preprocessed Images and Labels 
    # In this step, we will load the preprocessed images and their corresponding labels from the  real_processed  and  fake_processed  folders. We will assign labels of 0 to real images and labels of 1 to fake images. 
    # Here is the code to load the preprocessed images and labels:
